    "## Ethics of ML as a tool for Natural Hazard Prediction & Prevention\n",
    "Machine Learning is emerging as an important predictive tool in natural disaster prevention. Numerous studies have used machine learning to classify risk of natural hazards, from landslides, floods, and erosion in Saudi Arabia [@youssef2023multi], to avalanche risk in mountainous regions [@choubin2019snow], to area of forest fires in the tropics [@li2023attentionfire_v1]. In fact, the Portuguese fire data used in this project was originally the topic of a 2007 paper focusing on training models on readily available real-time meteorological data to predict the area of wildfires [@cortez2007data].\n",
    "\n",
    "So, there is a growing library of academic literature and projects using Machine Learning models to predict either the occurrence or the scale of natural hazards. Our project builds on these works, using many similar techniques and models. As our high testing accuracy for the Algerian dataset shows, machine learning clearly can be a powerful tool in natural hazard prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "But this numerical, scientific, approach comes with risks. As Cortez and Morais note in their study of Monteshino National Park in Portugal, most fires are caused by humans, which is why features like day of the week are important. Natural hazards only become natural disasters when they have a negative impact on people’s lives. As Youseff et al. observe in their study of multi-hazard prediction in Saudi Arabia, multiple hazards often occur at the same time, and the impact of natural hazards disproportionately affects impoverished and underdeveloped countries [@youssef2023multi]. A risk of our approach is that our models focus only on the fires, disregarding both human influence on the landscape that may lead to increased risk of hazards (e.g. overdrawing from local water sources, deforestation, etc.), as well as the impact fires may have on humans. Predicting whether or not a fire will occur, or how large it will be, is only useful if it is applied to help those at risk from fires.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wagenaar et al.’s 2020 paper “Invited perspectives: How machine learning will change flood risk and impact assessment” touches on some of these ethical considerations [@wagenaar2020invited]. One risk they bring up is that improved knowledge of flood risk from ML models might result in protection of only high-value land or property owned by the wealthy. That example is certainly transferable to our fire hazard project. They also raise the question of privacy, noting that some people might not want it widely known that their home is considered “at-risk” for flooding, or other hazards. Finally, there is the question of data. The causes of hazards in one place may not cause the same hazard in another, so it is important to understand which human and geographic features influence hazard risk at a local scale rather than trying to train a one-size-fits-all model.\n",
    "\n",
    "With all that in mind, our project needs to come with an asterisk. We have trained models for forest fire occurrence and scale in two specific places. It is therefore unreasonable to expect that our model will perfectly transfer to other places in the world. If our project were to be used for any application beyond the academic, we would need to make sure that its impact – whether that be for risk management, insurance policies, or some other application – be equitable and nondiscriminatory. We are just scratching the surface of using Machine Learning for natural hazard prevention, and while our results show it to be a powerful tool, we must also stay vigilant to make sure that it is a force for good.\n",
