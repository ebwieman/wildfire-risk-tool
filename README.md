## Risk Statement
We need to be wary of overfitting our models; the size of our datasets are a big factor. We will be training models on small datasets which means that it will be difficult to avoid training a model that has limited application beyond the specific geographic range represented in the Portuguese or Algerian forest fires datasets. We should keep this in mind instead of trying to achieve perfect predictive and classification accuracy, no matter the cost. Additionally, while we have many features relating to weather and climate in our dataset, there are other important features that are not represented in the data: what species of trees are native to the region, what the density of undergrowth is on the forest floor, if the region is grazed by animals, soil pH, and more. Itâ€™s possible that these are just as significant as weather and climate in causing forest fires, and the absence of these data could hamper our ability to train accurate models.
