    "## Introduction\n",
    "Climate change has increased the likelihood of a variety of extreme weather events, including wildfires. These extreme events pose definite risks to both human and ecological communities. At the same time, machine learning is emerging as an important predictive tool in natural disaster prevention; numerous studies have already used machine learning to classify risk of natural hazards. For example, Youssef et al. used machine learning models to predict an area’s susceptibility to landslides, floods, and erosion in Saudi Arabia [@youssef2023multi]. This study experimented with a few different models, ultimately settling on Random Forest. In Choubin et al.’s study of avalanches in mountainous regions, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multivariate Discriminant Analysis were found to be the best models in assessing avalanche risk based on meteorological and locational data [@choubin2019snow]. \n",
    "\n",
    "Prior studies have also focused specifically on wildfire prediction. A 2023 paper even developed a new model to better predict burned areas in Africa and South America [@li2023attentionfire_v1]. In addition, the dataset used in our project to predict Portuguese fires was originally the topic of a 2007 paper focusing on training models on readily available meteorological data to predict the area of wildfires [@cortez2007data]. This study also experimented with different predictive features and models, finding SVM and random forest to be the best predictors [@cortez2007data]. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we build on these prior studies, using many similar techniques and models. We use two datasets to predict wildfire likelihood and wildfire area given meteorological data. Our first dataset, the Algerian Forest Fires Dataset, contains fire and non-fire events with 11 attributes that describe weather characteristics at the time of that event. Our second dataset, the Forest Fires Dataset, contains data from Montesinho National Park, Portugal. This dataset contains many of the same weather characteristics as the Algerian dataset, but has only fire events, and also includes the areas of these events. Rather than using this dataset to predict whether a fire occurred in a given area, we used it to predict the size a fire is likely to reach given certain meteorological conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Over the course of this project, we followed in the footsteps of prior studies, experimenting with different models to predict risk. We implemented several existing machine learning models such as Random Forest and Logistic Regression, ultimately choosing the models and sets of features that yielded the highest accuracy score. We trained and validated models on the Algerian dataset to predict whether or not a forest fire will occur given certain meteorological conditions and also trained/validated models on the Portugal dataset to predict forest fire area given many of the same features. \n",
    "Although we trained our models with  localized data, we also assessed the extent to which we could apply our models across datasets and geographies. Similarly to the multi-hazard susceptibility map produced by Youssef et al., we created a fire susceptibility map of fire risk using our models and county-level temperature and precipitation data for the entire United States [@youssef2023multi]. While we cannot assess the accuracy of this map directly, we can compare it to existing US wildfire prediction tools to at least visually assess our accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we build on existing research to assess the ethics of using machine learning models in predicting risk of natural hazards. As Wagenaar et al. caution in their 2020 study of how machine learning will change flood risk and impact assessment, “applicability, bias and ethics must be considered carefully to avoid misuse” of machine learning algorithms [@wagenaar2020invited]. \n",
    "\n",
    "As extreme weather events become more prevalent with climate change, we must learn how to best predict and manage these events. The methods explored detail our own attempt to do so. "

    "## Values Statement\n",
    "Being able to accurately predict the risks of wildfires offers numerous benefits for various stakeholders. Predictive models like ours have the potential to revolutionize wildfire management and mitigation strategies, leading to better preparedness, timely response, and ultimately, the protection of lives and property. Thus, we wanted to build upon prior studies and further the ability to accurately predict wildfires. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main beneficiaries of this project are the wildfire departments and emergency responders. These agencies can gain valuable insights into the probability and severity of wildfire occurrences in specific areas though our project. These predictions allow for better allocation of resources and more effective mitigation strategies, reducing the overall damage and saving tons of valuable resources. If we can assess areas with high-risk for wildfires ahead of time, they could be better equipped and protected. \n",
    "\n",
    "Insurance companies can also leverage our predictive models to assess risks associated with wildfires. By integrating these algorithms into their underwriting processes, insurers can accurately evaluate the potential impact of wildfires on properties, allowing for more precise risk assessment. Moreover, the models can aid in post–fire analysis, enabling insurance companies to provide timely assistance to policyholders living in at-risk areas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Government agencies responsible for land and forest management are also another one of our potential users. Policymakers can make more informed decisions regarding land use, forest management, and allocation of resources for fire prevention efforts. Ultimately, this can lead to more proactive measures such as improved firebreak construction and targeted vegetation management. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another group that may not directly utilize our predictive wildfire models, but still stands to benefit is the general population. Information that trickles down from fire management authorities can help individuals living in fire-prone areas make informed decisions and take the necessary precautions. People are able to take property protection measures and implement evacuation plans they deem necessary. Overall, the predictions from these models can increase safety measures while minimizing property damage within the predicted at-risk areas. \n",
    "\n",
    "While the use of machine learning models to predict wildfire risks can be highly beneficial, there are potential downsides with their implementation that should be considered. Our models rely heavily on well documented weather and geographical data. Data collection takes time and money, which could potentially be a barrier to using our models. Remote areas without government or research funding most likely will not be able to produce the data needed to benefit from our models. Moreover, communities lacking internet access, computing devices, or technological literacy are unable to take advantage of our models. This can disproportionately affect rural areas and low-income communities, further exacerbating existing inequalities. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we recognize that our models are trained and tested on data that is in English. This language barrier can hinder individuals who don’t have the proficiency in the language, limiting their ability to use these predictive models. Additionally, cultural differences and contextual nuances might not be well captured in our models, leading to potential misunderstandings and biases. Thus, we want to be mindful of the potential barriers and hope to address these shortcomings in our future work. Failing to address these disparities could perpetuate social inequalities in wildfire management. \n",
    "\n",
    "Upon reflecting these potential harms and benefits, we still believe this project will improve wildfire management and be a crucial resource to communities in fire-prone areas. Additionally, this project furthers our understanding of factors contributing to wildfires. With this information, we can accurately predict the likelihood of wildfires in a given region, enabling better fire management, mitigation, and evacuation. Wildfire predictions can help protect the land, wildlife, and local communities. Still, efforts should be made to actively involve marginalized groups in wildfire preparedness and response initiatives.\n"

    "## Materials and Methods\n",
    "#### The Datasets\n",
    "In this project, we utilized various machine learning models from scikit-learn to better understand wildfire occurrences. Specifically, we trained and tested on two datasets to predict wildfire likelihood and wildfire area given the meteorological and geographical features. These datasets were taken from the University of California Irvine Machine Learning Repository. Our first dataset, the Algerian Forest Fires Dataset, contains fire and non-fire occurrences with 11 attributes describing weather characteristics at the time the event occurred. Our second dataset, the Forest Fires Data, has data from Montesinho National Park, Portugal. This dataset contains many of the same weather attributes as the Algerian one. However, rather than using this dataset to predict whether a fire occurred in a given area, it can be used to predict the size of the fire given certain meteorological and geographical conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Algerian dataset has 224 instances that regrouped data from two regions in Algeria, namely the Bejaia region located in the northeast of Algeria and the Sidi Bel-abbes region in the northwest of Algeria. There are 122 instances for each of the two regions. This data was collected from June 2012 to September 2012. As stated, the dataset contains fire and non-fire events with 13 attributes that describe weather conditions. The 13 features are: day, month, year, temperature in Celsius, relative humidity, wind speed, rain, fine fuel moisture code, duff moisture code, drought code, initial speed index, build up index, and fire weather index. Our target label is “fire”, with a label of 1.0 meaning that a fire has occurred and 0.0 being no fire. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data collected in the Portugal dataset was taken from Montesino park in the northeast region of Portugal. The 12 features in this dataset are similar to the ones in the Algerian dataset. These features include: x-axis spatial coordinate, y-axis spatial coordinate, month, day, fine fuel moisture code, duff moisture code, drought code, initial speed index, temperature in Celsius, relative humidity, wind, and rain. The target label is “fire are”, which determines the total burned area of a fire given the meteorological and geographical conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### US Meteorological Data and Mapping Tool\n",
    "County level precipitation and temperature data was downloaded from the NOAA NClimGrid dataset. Specific months of interest were selected and data was downloaded for that month as two csvs, one containing precipitation data and one containing temperature data. The precipitation data contained total precipitation in mm for each day of the month for each US county, while the temperature data contained maximum temperature in Celsius for each day. Significant time was spent searching for additional meteorological data, specifically wind speed and humidity, but these efforts were ultimately unsuccessful. The temperature and precipitation datasets were uploaded to GitHub and then loaded into the Mapping Tool Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Substantial data cleaning was performed to prepare the US data for prediction. Data cleaning tasks included renaming columns after the datasets were read in and resolving discrepancies in the state and county codes so that data frames could be merged by county. The precipitation and temperature datasets were read in, converted to pandas dataframes, and merged. From this dataframe, data was extracted for a specified day and county-level wildfire predictions were generated for that day. Predictions were generated using a new Random Forest model that was trained on the Algeria dataset using only Temperature and Rain as features, as these were the only features we had access to for US data. These predictions were then joined with a dataframe containing geological coordinates for each county and then the predictions were mapped. The final algorithm used for mapping allows the user to put in a date and state and then produces a map of county-level fire risk for that state on the specified day. If there is no data for the specified day, the algorithm returns a message apologizing for the lack of data. If no state is specified, the algorithm returns a map of the entire continental US. While the maps could not be rigorously assessed for accuracy, visual comparison to the USGS Fire Danger Map Tool was used to discuss the accuracy of our Algerian model when applied to US data."

    "## Results\n",
    "We came close to achieving all of our goals for this project. Our greatest success was our modeling of the Algerian dataset. We achieved high training accuracy with several models, including > 95% training accuracy for a Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree Classifier, as well as 100% testing accuracy with a Logistic Regression model. It’s difficult to say how applicable this model is outside of the region of Algeria the data are from. The random forest classifier that we trained on the Algerian model for our mapping tool got many things right – it predicts more widespread fire in the summer months, for example, than in the winter – but we trained it on many fewer features than are in the full Algerian dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is certainly one of the shortcomings of our project. The lack of weather data available for the United States means that we can’t fully say how well our model would perform on data from a region other than Algeria. However, there are positive trends, and were more weather observations available, it seems likely that our model would have some applicability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the fact that we did not get to realize the full abilities of our model, creating an interactive map is nonetheless a highlight of the project. It shows that our project has the ability to be broadly applicable, and underscores the power of Machine Learning as a tool for natural hazard prediction and prevention. We explored the ethical dimensions of this application of Machine Learning in a short essay, and while there are certainly ethical considerations that must be made when training models to predict natural hazards, this project shows that there is also a great deal of opportunity to use Machine Learning to predict and manage risks from natural hazards.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final area of our project to discuss is the models we trained for the Portuguese dataset. Replicating the process of the original academic paper didn’t yield results of the same accuracy as those obtained by the study [@cortez2007data]. Log-transforming the data was a complex process that was perhaps more involved than we had anticipated. However, we still managed to achieve about 50% accuracy with both Linear Regression and Support Vector Machine models, and 100% accuracy when we transformed to binary labels. This, along with our high testing accuracy for the Algeria dataset, shows that predicting whether or not a fire occurred is a much more straightforward task than predicting the area of the fire. There is certainly room to grow in our modeling of this dataset; perhaps trying different models or features would yield different results. Nonetheless, our process and results show that it is possible to build a model trained on readily-available weather observations that predicts the area of fires with a reasonable degree of accuracy.\n"
